I am currently a PhD Student at CU Boulder in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, working in the [Climate Processes and Predictability](https://sites.google.com/site/aneeshcs/Home?authuser=0) research group. My background includes an undergraduate degree in Physics, a Masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and five years in environmental consulting before making my way back to research in the Fall of 2021. I am interested in the intersection of process-based models and observations, and am currently working on ways of using machine learning to improve data assimilation methods.

Since 2023 I have been collaborating with the Joint Center for Sattelite Data Assimilation on incorporating ML methods into observation operators for assimilation of sattelite data.
